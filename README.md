# attendance-management-system

This is the web project ‘attendance management system’. By using this project we can take attendance on the web page from any computer.
If student is present then we check on the present box of the option and if student is absent then we check the absent box of the option.
In this way, working of web based attendance is quite good rather than register work. We can get report of attendance immediately by viewing or printing the database.
Students who are registered, can check their attendance details, subject details, etc. If attendance of any student is short, he would be noticed.
The main aim of the project is to reduce paper work, save time, automatic calculation of attendance and cheatings of students during attendance.
